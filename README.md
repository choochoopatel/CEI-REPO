# CEI-REPO
Welcome to my project, the following code demonstrates a website that showcases all the projects that I have completed since I have been up at Penn State. Not only does it share information about me and what the page is about but also showcases a form for anyone to fill out regarding additional feedback on my projects such as assessing any ratings on the different projects to improve upon my skills or share additional ideas for projects .
